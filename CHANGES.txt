Changelog
=========

1.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- fix getSite import for Zope 2.13
  [toutpt]
- Added option to prevent login unless user has some role on the portal.
  This effectively requires some user enumeration source to be present.
  This option is disabled by default.
  [davidjb]
- Added initial unit tests for configuration. 
  [davidjb]
- Changed to use plone.app.registry for configuration. This reduces control
  panel complexity greatly and allows GenericSetup import and export of
  values from plone.app.registry. This change requires collective.castle to
  be upgraded in the Add-ons control panel.
  [davidjb]
- Redefine portal_actions items to not override Plone's original login and
  logout actions but create new actions. This satisfies the use-case of 
  potentially using Plone's original actions in cases of multiple souces of
  authentication.
  [davidjb]
- Control panel cancel button now redirects to overview.
  [davidjb]
- Added descriptions to control panel fields.
  [davidjb]
- Lengthen the input fields on the CAS control panel page for ease of entry.
  [davidjb]
- Ensure latest Plone versions display the CAS icon in the control panel.
  [davidjb]
- Fix AttributeError when looking up `context.request` if a CAS URL isn't
  configured and users are logged out.
  [davidjb]
- Use navigation root rather than portal for the log out URL.
  [davidjb]
- Fix creation of CAS4PAS plugin when one doesn't exist on CAS control panel
  load.
  [davidjb]

- Rename the title of the GS-profile to the id of the package, which avoids
  confusion when similarly named packages exist. [WouterVH]

- Add CAS-icon to the control-panel. [WouterVH]

- Add docs/INSTALL.txt  [WouterVH]

- Add CHANGES.txt [WouterVH]
